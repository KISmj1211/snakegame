This game is WIP, however, even if some bugs might happen the rules are.
## How To Play
1. Eat as MANY snacks for LONG lengths of the Snake
2. Do not try to bump into yourself or on a wall to make your eating progress killed
3. Get purple blocks that give you more points, but however gives a dizzy-ness to the snake to make them move opposite directions
